name: fluent-review
description: Run today's spaced-repetition review queue — items scheduled by SM-2 that need reinforcement before the learner forgets them. Triggered only when the learner types /fluent-review. Pulls due items from spaced-repetition.review_queue.today, generates a targeted exercise for each, evaluates the response, updates SM-2 parameters, and reshelves items into the correct future queue.

# Spaced-Repetition Review Session

## Overview

Replay items the learner learned before, timed so they hit just before the forgetting curve drops them. This is the single most effective session type — the system depends on it running daily. Items the learner gets right get pushed further into the future; items they miss come back tomorrow.

## When to Use

Trigger this skill only when the learner types `/fluent-review`. The skill is gated with `disable-model-invocation: true` — mutating SM-2 state from a misread prompt would cascade through every future session.

Skip this skill when the queue is empty — suggest `/fluent-vocab` or `/fluent-learn` instead.

## Instructions

### 1. Load review queue

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-.}}/.claude/hooks/read-db.py" --review
```

`--review` sorts `spaced-repetition.review_queue.today` by `priority` (critical → high → medium → low) and caps it at `daily_limits.review_items_per_day` server-side, so only the items you'll actually use come back expanded. Use `computed.due_reviews_count` for the true total due when writing the opening message — it can be larger than the trimmed queue.

If the queue is empty:

```markdown
🎉 No reviews due today! Your spaced repetition is up to date.

Want to practice something new? Try:
- `/fluent-learn` — adaptive mixed practice
- `/fluent-vocab` — learn new words
- `/fluent-progress` — see your stats
```

### 2. Opening

```markdown
# 🔄 Today's Spaced Repetition Review

Hallo {name}! Time to review items your brain is about to forget. This keeps everything fresh. 🧠

**Items Due Today:** {count}
**Estimated Time:** ~{minutes} min

Why review? Spaced repetition prevents forgetting, moves items into long-term memory, and builds automaticity.

**Ready? Let's start!** 💪
```

### 3. Generate exercise per item

Each item has:

```json
{
  "item_id": "...",
  "item_type": "error_pattern | vocabulary | grammar_rule",
  "easiness_factor": 2.5,
  "interval_days": 6,
  "repetitions": 2,
  "due_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "priority": "critical | high | medium | low",
  "content": "...",
  "answer": "..."
}
```

Generate an exercise matched to `item_type`:

- **error_pattern**: load the pattern from `mistakes-db`, create a scenario that forces the correct form. E.g. `formal_informal_confusion` → ask the learner to complete a formal email opening.
- **vocabulary**: recognition (target → native), production (native → target), or cloze — rotate modes.
- **grammar_rule**: a fill-in or error-correction exercise that tests the rule.

Present one at a time:

```markdown
## Review {N}/{total} — {priority emoji}

**Type:** {item_type}
**Last reviewed:** {X} days ago
**Current mastery:** {stars}

{exercise}

**Type your answer:**
```

### 4. Evaluate + update SM-2

Use the `fluent-feedback-formatter` skill for per-answer feedback.

Then stage the item for the end-of-session update. Do NOT hand-edit `spaced-repetition.json` — use `review_results[]` in the `fluent-db-updater` payload:

```json
{ "item_id": "vocab_huis", "quality": 4 }
```

The `update-db.py` script runs the SM-2 math (see `fluent-sm2-calculator` skill) and rebuilds the queue. Mapping: `quality = floor(score / 2)`.

### 5. Progress pulse every 5 items

```markdown
## Progress Update

**Reviewed:** {N}/{total}
**Accuracy:** {percent}%
**Time Remaining:** ~{min} min

Keep going! 💪
```

### 6. Session summary

```markdown
## 🎉 Review Session Complete!

**Reviewed:** {count}
**Accuracy:** {percent}%
**Time:** {min} min

### Breakdown

**Mastered (no mistakes):** {count} — won't appear again for a while 🎉
**Good (minor slips):** {count} — next in {X} days
**Need more practice:** {count} — tomorrow again

### Next Review Schedule
- Tomorrow: {count}
- This week: {count}
- Next week: {count}

**Streak:** 🔥 {X} {day/days} 🔥

**Tip:** {one line of advice based on accuracy}

{target-language well done}! 🌟
```

### 7. Update all databases

Use the `fluent-db-updater` skill:

- `command_used: "/fluent-review"`, `skills_practiced: [derived from reviewed items]`
- `skill_scores` — aggregate per skill touched
- `review_results[]` — every item reviewed, with `quality`
- `errors[]` — only patterns where the learner got it wrong (bumps frequency)
- `focus_next_session[]` — the 2-3 items with lowest quality this session

Save exchange to `/results/fluent-review-session-{NNN}.md` for later analysis.

## Examples

### Example 1 — vocabulary review with wrong answer

> ## Review 3/12 — 🔴
>
> **Type:** vocabulary
> **Last reviewed:** 6 days ago
> **Current mastery:** ⭐⭐⭐☆☆
>
> **Dutch:** het raam
>
> **What does it mean in English?**

Learner: "the door"

> ❌ Close — those are both openings in a wall, but not the same.
>
> **Corrections:**
> - 🟡 "the door" → **"the window"** (vocabulary — `het raam` is window; `de deur` is door)
>
> **Correct version:**
> "het raam" = the window.
>
> **Score: 3/10** 💪 Easy to mix — we'll review this again soon.
>
> (Logged: `review_results[]` item quality=1 → `interval_days=1, repetitions=0`, stays in today's queue.)

### Example 2 — correct answer with mastery bump

> ## Review 7/12 — 🟡
>
> **Type:** grammar_rule
> **Last reviewed:** 14 days ago
> **Current mastery:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆
>
> **Complete:** "Ik schrijf u omdat ik ____ kan komen." (reason: can't come)

Learner: "niet"

> ✅ Perfect — omdat-clause word order locked in.
>
> **Answer:** "Ik schrijf u omdat ik niet kan komen."
>
> **Score: 10/10** 🎯
>
> (Logged: quality=5 → `interval_days = round(14 * EF)`, queue: `later`. `consecutive_correct` = 5, mastery → 5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐.)

## Critical Rules

- **Daily.** The whole system assumes the learner runs `/fluent-review` every day. Missing a day breaks the intended spacing.
- **Never auto-invoke.** Gated; must fire only on explicit `/fluent-review`. Long interactive + SM-2 mutation.
- **One item at a time.** Rushing = false positives.
- **Let the learner struggle.** If they don't remember, that's useful data (quality 0-2). The algorithm needs honest signals.
- **Never hand-edit `spaced-repetition.json`.** Queue is rebuilt on every `update-db.py` call.

## What the Schedule Means

Tell the learner if they ask:

- 1 day — new or struggling items
- 2-3 days — learning, building strength
- 1 week — getting comfortable
- 2+ weeks — strong, maintenance only
- 1+ month — mastered, long-term memory
