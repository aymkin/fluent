> **This is a personal fork** of [m98/fluent](https://github.com/m98/fluent), maintained at
> [aymkin/fluent](https://github.com/aymkin/fluent). It tracks upstream but has diverged:
> FSRS-6 scheduling (replacing SM-2), and a trimmed
> `/fluent-review` data payload for faster response times. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)
> for the full list. The install ref is `fluent@aymkin` — the `@` suffix is the *marketplace*
> name from `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` (`"name": "aymkin"`), not the git remote or the
> upstream author.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add aymkin/fluent && claude plugin install fluent@aymkin
```

One line. Registers the marketplace, installs the plugin. Works globally from any directory after this.

### 2. Start learning

Restart Claude Code, then:

```
/fluent-setup     # onboard: name, target language, level, goals
/fluent-learn     # begin your first session
```

That's it.

---

### Requirements

- [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com) installed
- **Python 3.8+** (most systems already have it — check with `python3 --version`). Install via [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/), `brew install python3`, or your distro's package manager. No pip packages needed — Fluent uses only the standard library.

### Verify, update, uninstall

```bash
claude plugin list                    # expect: fluent@aymkin  enabled
claude plugin update fluent@aymkin    # pull latest version
claude plugin uninstall fluent@aymkin # remove entirely
```

### Alternative: git clone

Prefer to hack on the skills or keep per-project state?

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aymkin/fluent.git
cd fluent
claude plugin marketplace add ./ && claude plugin install fluent@aymkin
claude          # launch from repo root
/fluent-setup
```

Learner data lives in `./data/` inside the cloned repo instead of `~/.claude/fluent-data/`.

The `marketplace add ./` step is not optional if you want the hooks. Skills load from a bare
clone, but hooks are registered only through `.claude/hooks/hooks.json`, which Claude Code
reads via the plugin manifest. Skip the step and you get the slash commands with **no
SessionStart briefing, no JSON validation, and no automatic backups**.

### Where your data lives

Fluent resolves the data directory in this order — first match wins:

1. `$FLUENT_DATA_DIR` if set (override everything).
2. `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/data/` if it has `learner-profile.json` (clone mode, running from outside the repo root).
3. `./data/` if it has `learner-profile.json` (clone mode, running inside the repo).
4. `~/.claude/fluent-data/` (plugin-install default).

Set `FLUENT_DATA_DIR` to run multiple learners on one machine:

```bash
export FLUENT_DATA_DIR=~/.fluent/dutch
```

Check where Fluent is currently looking:

```bash
python3 -c "import sys; sys.path.insert(0, '.claude/hooks'); from fluent_paths import data_dir; print(data_dir())"
```

## 📚 How It Works

### The Learning Loop

Every practice session follows this intelligent cycle:

| Step | What Happens | Why It Matters |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| **1. You Practice** | Answer a question in your target language | Active recall forces your brain to retrieve information |
| **2. AI Analyzes** | System evaluates your response instantly | Identifies exactly what you got right or wrong |
| **3. Get Feedback** | Clear explanation of mistakes + correct version | Learning happens when you understand WHY |
| **4. System Tracks** | Updates all 6 databases automatically | Remembers your weak spots and strengths |
| **5. Adapts** | Next question matches your current level | Always challenging, never frustrating |

**What Gets Tracked:**
- ✅ **Error Patterns** - Which grammar/vocab you struggle with
- ✅ **Mastery Levels** - Your skill rating (0-5 stars) for each topic
- ✅ **Review Schedule** - When to review based on FSRS-6 algorithm
- ✅ **Progress Stats** - Accuracy trends, streak days, total practice time
---

## 🎮 Available Commands & Skills

Fluent is built as **Claude Code skills** — 12 of them. Skills work two ways:

1. **Type the slash command** (`/fluent-learn`, `/fluent-vocab`, etc.) — you explicitly start a session. Learner-facing skills are gated so they only run this way. No accidental 20-minute session triggered by a chat message.
2. **Ask naturally** — read-only skills like `/fluent-progress` auto-trigger when you ask "how am I doing?" or "what's my streak?". Helper skills (FSRS reference, feedback formatter, DB updater, session analyzer) auto-load whenever Claude needs them during a session.

All 12 skills appear in your `/` menu so you can always invoke any of them manually.

### Learner-facing commands

These are the commands you'll use daily. Each is backed by a dedicated skill under `.claude/skills/`.

#### Core Commands

| Command | What It Does | When & Why to Use It |
|---------|--------------|----------------------|
| **`/fluent-setup`** | **One-time onboarding** - Asks you questions about your name, target language, current level, goals, and timeline. Creates your personalized learning profile. | **First time only** - Run this once to set up your account. The system generates a custom learning plan based on your answers. |
| **`/fluent-learn`** | **Adaptive mixed practice** - Combines different exercise types (vocabulary, grammar, sentences) based on your weak areas. Adjusts difficulty in real-time based on your performance. | **Daily core practice** - Your main command for general improvement. The AI decides what you need to practice most. Best after `/fluent-review`. |
| **`/fluent-review`** | **Spaced repetition session** - Shows you items that are due for review today based on the FSRS-6 algorithm. Focuses on things you learned before that need reinforcement. | **Start every day here!** - Review before learning new content. This is scientifically proven to be the most effective way to retain what you've learned. |

#### Skill-Specific Commands

| Command | What It Does | When & Why to Use It |
|---------|--------------|----------------------|
| **`/fluent-vocab`** | **Flashcard-style vocabulary drills** - Rapid-fire translation practice (target language ↔ native language). Tracks which words you struggle with. | **2-3x per week** - When you need to build vocabulary quickly. Great for preparing for specific topics (travel, business, etc.). |
| **`/fluent-writing`** | **Writing practice** - Practice emails, letters, essays, or forms in your target language. Get detailed corrections with grammar explanations. | **Daily for exam prep** - Essential if you're preparing for language exams. Also great for building confidence in real-world communication. |
| **`/fluent-speaking`** | **Conversation practice** - Role-play scenarios through typed dialogue. Practice natural conversations, asking for directions, ordering food, etc. | **2-3x per week** - Builds confidence for real conversations. Typed practice helps you think through responses without pressure. |
| **`/fluent-reading`** | **Reading comprehension** - Read short texts (stories, articles, dialogues) then answer comprehension questions. Expands vocabulary in context. | **2-3x per week** - Improves overall understanding. Best for intermediate+ learners. Reading is one of the fastest ways to absorb grammar patterns. |

#### Progress Command

| Command | What It Does | When & Why to Use It |
|---------|--------------|----------------------|
| **`/fluent-progress`** | **Statistics dashboard** - Shows your accuracy trends, streak days, mastery levels, achievements unlocked, and weak areas. Visual progress charts. | **Weekly check-in** - Read-only and safe to auto-invoke. Ask "how am I doing?" and Claude will open the dashboard automatically. |

### Helper skills (behind the scenes)

These skills don't change what the learner-facing commands do — they let Claude apply the same algorithms, feedback format, and database logic consistently across every session. You can still invoke them via `/` if curious.

| Skill | What It Does | When It Runs |
|-------|--------------|--------------|
| **`/fluent-fsrs-reference`** | FSRS-6 scheduling reference: score→quality→rating→FSRS pipeline, live vs vestigial fields, intervals computed by code. | Auto-loaded whenever scheduling must be reasoned about. |
| **`/fluent-feedback-formatter`** | Canonical per-answer feedback template — severity tagging (🔴 critical / 🟡 moderate / 🟢 minor), category labels, tone rules. | Auto-loaded every time Claude grades an answer. |
| **`/fluent-db-updater`** | How to call `update-db.py` with a single JSON payload that atomically updates all 6 databases at session end. | Auto-loaded when a session ends. |
| **`/fluent-session-analyzer`** | Parses `/results/fluent-{skill}-session-{NNN}.md` files to extract error patterns, strengths, and focus areas for the next session. | Auto-loaded when planning the next session. |

### 📅 Recommended Daily Routine

**🌅 Morning Session (15 min)**
```bash
/fluent-review    # Must do first - Review what you learned before
/fluent-vocab     # Learn 5-10 new words
```
**Why?** Your brain is fresh. Reviewing first reinforces old knowledge, then new vocabulary sticks better.

**🌙 Evening Session (15 min)**
```bash
/fluent-writing   # Practice real-world writing
/fluent-learn     # Let AI choose what you need most
```
**Why?** Writing solidifies what you learned today. `/fluent-learn` fills in any gaps.

**📊 Weekly Check-In (5 min)**
```bash
/fluent-progress  # See your stats and celebrate progress!
```
**Why?** Seeing improvement = motivation. You need to see you're getting better!

## 📁 System Architecture

### Data Layer (`/data` directory)

**Your learning data is tracked in 6 JSON databases** (created automatically by `/fluent-setup`):

| File | Purpose | Created When |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `learner-profile.json` | Your info, level, preferences, streak | `/fluent-setup` - One time |
| `progress-db.json` | Overall statistics and trends | `/fluent-setup` - Updated every session |
| `mistakes-db.json` | Error patterns with frequency and examples | `/fluent-setup` - Updated when you make mistakes |
| `mastery-db.json` | Skill mastery levels (0-5 stars) | `/fluent-setup` - Updated after practice |
| `spaced-repetition.json` | Review queue (FSRS-6 algorithm) | `/fluent-setup` - Updated after each answer |
| `session-log.json` | Complete session history | `/fluent-setup` - New entry each session |

**📋 Want to see the structure?** Check `/data-examples/` for template files showing the complete schema.

**🔒 Privacy:** All data stays on your machine. Automatically excluded from git via `.gitignore`.

### Intelligence Layer

The AI follows these guides:

- **`LEARNING_SYSTEM.md`** - Complete methodology (how to teach)
- **`CLAUDE.md`** - AI tutor's role and personality
- **`AGENTS.md`** - Entry point for non-Claude CLIs (Codex, Gemini)
- **`results/README.md`** - Canonical session-file format that `fluent-session-analyzer` parses
- **`.claude/references/`** - Shared payload schema (`db-updater-payload.example.json`) used by `update-db.py`

### Interface Layer

- **Skills** (`.claude/skills/`) — 12 skills total. 8 learner-facing (`/fluent-setup`, `/fluent-learn`, `/fluent-vocab`, `/fluent-writing`, `/fluent-speaking`, `/fluent-reading`, `/fluent-review`, `/fluent-progress`) run when you invoke them. 4 helper skills (`/fluent-fsrs-reference`, `/fluent-feedback-formatter`, `/fluent-db-updater`, `/fluent-session-analyzer`) auto-load whenever Claude needs them during a session — and are also directly `/`-invokable if you want to read the reference.
- **Plugin manifests** (`.claude-plugin/`) — `plugin.json` + `marketplace.json` make Fluent installable via `/plugin marketplace add aymkin/fluent`.
- **Automatic Hooks** (`.claude/hooks/`) — SessionStart welcome, PostToolUse JSON validation + timestamped backups. `hooks.json` is the single registration for both install paths, wired in through `plugin.json`. Backup layers and recovery: [`.claude/hooks/README.md`](.claude/hooks/README.md).
- **Session Results** (`/results/`) — Detailed practice logs per session, parsed by `fluent-session-analyzer` to plan future sessions.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

**`python3: command not found` when hooks run.**
Install Python 3.8+ and make sure `python3` is on your PATH. On macOS: `brew install python3`. On Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install python3`. On Windows: install via [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or use WSL.

**Learner data is showing up in the wrong place.**
Check the data-dir resolution order (see above). Set `FLUENT_DATA_DIR` explicitly in your shell to force a specific location.

**JSON validation fails after a manual edit.**
The PostToolUse hook exits with status 2 if it finds malformed JSON. The last 10 backups live at `<data_dir>/<filename>.json.backup-<timestamp>`. Restore with: `cp <data_dir>/learner-profile.json.backup-XXXXXX <data_dir>/learner-profile.json`.

**Skills don't appear in the `/` menu after plugin install.**
Restart Claude Code. If still missing, verify install:

```bash
claude plugin list                              # should show fluent@aymkin enabled
claude plugin validate fluent@aymkin
```

Or from inside a session: `/plugin list`. If the plugin is disabled, enable it: `claude plugin enable fluent@aymkin`.
